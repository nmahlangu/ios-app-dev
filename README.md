# Learning iOS Programming (with Swift!)
Just a repo for the Stanford CS193P projects I'm working on over summer 2015!
I've been meaning to build develop for the iPhone for some number of years 
now and figured it would be a fun thing to learn alongside my Software 
Development Internship at Indiegogo.
